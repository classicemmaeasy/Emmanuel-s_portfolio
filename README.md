# PROJECT 1:  [Bike Sales Dashboard](https://github.com/classicemmaeasy/Bike-Sales-Dashboard)

Below is an interactive dashboard I built, which shows the bike sales in each region based on gender, Age groups and Marital Status.

The dataset used for the analysis is from Kaggle and before the dataset can used for calculations and creating interactive dashboard, data cleaning for handling messy and nasty data (data cleaning techniques)is very important and some of the techniques is as follows:

I) Using trim function  
II) Removing Duplicates
III) Removing  blanks (e.t.c)

After which the data is clean, I use pivot table to preview the total sales in each region and between ages and age groups.
The pivot tables help in building the interactive dashboard and charts, which is easily understandable and informative to even a layman.

Data Professional Breakdown using PowerBI

PowerBI is a business intelligence tool for analysing, aggregate and visualizing data to extract meaningful insights and informed decisions.
The dashboard below is a data Professional Breakdown of different niche in the data field,the data was collected by Alex Freberg to analyse people's experience and perspective about the data field.

 ⚓ The data niche that fit their current role
 
 ⚓ Average Salary by Job title
 
 ⚓ Difficulty to break into data
 
 ⚓ Happiness with Work/Life balance
 
 ⚓ Happiness with Salary
 
 ⚓ Favorite programming Languages

I did Tons of data cleaning and transforming to make the data easier to analyze and concise (power query).

# PROJECT 3:  [Data Exploration with SQL](https://github.com/classicemmaeasy/Data-Exploration-on-COVID19-dataset-with-SQL)
Structured Query Language is a standard programming language for collecting data and interacting  with the relational database (DBMS),
it is used for data cleaning, exploration and data manipulation, some of the techniques I use are below: 

 (Creating database), insert, distinct,group by ,order by e.tc. to the advance stage (CTE and Temp tables).
I was able to lay my hands on COVID-19 dataset and extract, aggregate informative and hidden insight for decision making.

#### key insight:

⚡total cases vs total death

⚡total cases vs population

⚡highest infection rate compared to the population
⚡Joining two tables to get reasonable insight

⚡ Countries with the highest death cases

⚡ Continent with highest death cases

⚡ Overall Total Percentage death

⚡ Percentage of people Vaccinated (CTE) and Temp tables.

# PROJECT 4:  [Tableau Dashboard on Covid-19 dataset](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/awogbindin.emmanuel/viz/TableauProject_16835878277970/Dashboard1)

Tableau is a visual analytics platform transforming the way we use data to solve problems empowering people and organizations to make the most of their data. It help to visualize and give insight rather than looking at tables.

The below dashboard gives informative insight  about COVID-19 data right  from the inception (2020) till this year 2023, and future forecast (prediction).
I manipulated and aggregated the data with SQL  before building the dashboard.

Key Insights:

⚡ Total Death per Continent

⚡ Percentage of Population Infected per Country

⚡Global numbers (Total Death Count)

⚡ Percentage Population Infected
