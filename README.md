# [Bike Sales Dashboard](https://github.com/classicemmaeasy/Bike-Sales-Dashboard)

Below is an interactive dashboard I built, which shows the bike sales in each region based on gender, Age groups and Marital Status.

The dataset used for the analysis is from Kaggle and before the dataset can used for calculations and creating interactive dashboard, data cleaning for handling messy and nasty data (data cleaning techniques)is very important and some of the techniques is as follows:
I) Using trim function  
II) Removing Duplicates
III) Removing  blanks (e.t.c)

After which the data is clean, I use pivot table to preview the total sales in each region and between ages and age groups.
The pivot tables help in building the interactive dashboard and charts, which is easily understandable and informative to even a layman.
